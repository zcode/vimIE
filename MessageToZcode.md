### Hello!

Sorry to communicate in this unusual way ... would you be open to giving up this "zcode" github username, please?

I'm part of a small team of hobbyists working on a soon-to-be open-source project, called "zcode", and this would be the perfect account for it. If you aren't using it for anything, would you be open to donating it? I'd be more than happy to give attribution, if that would be at all helpful?

If so, please add a comment to this PR and we can get in touch properly. Otherwise, I'd understand if you don't want to - we'll find something else.

Thanks!

Susan
